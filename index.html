        <h1>  My Love For Life  </h1>

        <p>

            As old as song, still fond of my love. You have the thing I'm 
            longing for. My lover, my bride, my partner in crime. I sing 
            to thee this song of mine. 
            
        <p>

            Oh sweetness, baby, cutie pie. My love for you, it never dies.
            Til old and cripple due to time. I'll still look into your pretty
            eyes. Your tender love it feels so sweet, like an afternoon
            where I brewed tea. No doubt in mind, because you are mine.
            I'll sing to thee oh love of mine.    

        </p>

        <p>
            My dear I fell for you too well. Since you have caused my heart 
            to swell. It beats, it pumps it runs and jumps. My heart it speeds
            when you are near. It aches when you are far my dear. Right now
            I cannot say it to your face, but remember that I love you through 
            the moon into space! 
        </p>
